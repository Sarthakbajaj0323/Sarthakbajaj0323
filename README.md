# Hi there, I’m **Sarthak** 👋  
Software Engineer | RPA Developer | Cloud Enthusiast  
Based in Panipat, India 🇮🇳

## 🔍 About Me  
I have 1+ years of experience working as an RPA Developer at UiPath (Feb 2023-Jun 2023 & Aug 2023-Jun 2024), followed by a role as Cloud Support Associate at AWS.  
Now, I’m actively seeking **Software Engineer / SDE1 roles** where I can build scalable systems, optimize workflows and drive impact.

When I’m not coding you’ll find me at the table-tennis table, playing chess or hitting the gym.
